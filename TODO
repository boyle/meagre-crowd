Things that should get done at some point.

If you have free time and are interested in looking at any of these,
have a look at the relevant code and drop an email to me
<alistair.js.boyle@gmail.com>. I'd be more than pleased to look
at any patches or discuss potential solutions.

These are somewhat arranged in order of priority. Highest at the top.

 - Run valgrind. Find bad allocations and uninitialized variables.
 - Refactor, refactor, refactor.
 - Add ability to increase verbosity (-v, -vv, -vvv) for debugging.
   - build so we can dump it into a spreadsheet.csv
 - Add ability to save to an output file (-o)
 - Change default to outputing on stdout, rather than default-filename.mm
 - Add other solvers - single system, SMP
   ?? which ones
 - Add ability to download from matrix libraries given input list [seperate script]
   - University of Florida sparse matrix collection
   - Harwell-Boeing sparse matrix collection
 ?? are there any other stats we'd like to collect?
 - Add type tests: condition number, singularity, symmetric, hermitian
   ?? others
 - Make some default lists of common matrices used in papers.
 - Look at KCachegrind, Callgrind for profiling.
 - Generate a (random?) (sparse?) right-hand-side if one is not provided.

Fix memory leaks:
 - there is a leak in one of the shared libraries atexit() - probably
   the BeBop sparse matrix loader library, maybe rewrite/extract the bits
   I need and clean it up, it seems to be only partially functional from my tests
