Compiling and Installing
------------------------

If checking out code from a repository, run

  ./autogen.sh

to regenerate the configure scripts.

Run the following commands to compile this program

  ./configure
  make
  make install

Run

  ./configure --prefix=<dir>

to have the files installed in a different location from the
default /usr/local (i.e. if you don't have root permission
and would like to install it in your home directory)

If you've used the get_dependancies script then you probably
want to run configure with

  ./configure LDFLAGS="-L$PWD/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib -Wl,-rpath,$PWD/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib" CPPFLAGS="-I $PWD/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/include" --prefix=$PWD/installed --enable-debug=yes

or something similar. The -L and -I directories should be
current locations for the files, while the -rpath should
be the final installed location.


Running the Tests
-----------------

To execute the test suite run

make check


Preparing for Distribution
--------------------------

To tar the archive, then expand, compile and run the test suite

  make distcheck

or, for local dependencies

  make distcheck DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS="LDFLAGS=\"-L$PWD/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib -Wl,-rpath,$PWD/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib\" CPPFLAGS=\"-I $PWD/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/include\""


Running the Program
-------------------

You can get test matrices from the University of Florida Sparse
Matrix collection. The first 292 matrices of the Univesity of
Florida collection are the Harwell-Boeing Sparse Matrix
collection, so you don't need to download both.

  http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/matrices

For usage information, run without any options

  meagre-crowd

For help indicating what the program can do run

  meagre-crowd --help

To load a matrix to solve using the default solver, using 2 MPI
processes, show some info on the matrix and time the solving of it:

  mpirun -n 2 ./meagre-crowd -i tests/test.mm -v -t

Note that you probably also need to submit a job to a scheduler if
you are on a larger multicore system. (bsub, qsub, sqsub?)

Currently, meagre-crowd determines file type from extensions,
it can only handle MatrixMarket format which it expects to have
a .mm extension. Rutherford-Boeing and Harwell-Boeing would be
.rb and .hb respectively.
