Things that should get done at some point.

If you have free time and are interested in looking at any of these,
have a look at the relevant code and drop an email to me
<alistair.js.boyle@gmail.com>. I'd be more than pleased to look
at any patches or discuss potential solutions.

These are somewhat arranged in order of priority. Highest at the top.

 - Run valgrind. Find bad allocations and uninitialized variables.
 - Refactor, refactor, refactor.
 - Get arbitrary (single) file loading working. (command line args)
   - recognize file type from extension
   - fail gracefully when no input is provided (show help, error)
   - fail gracefully when a file is MIA (error)
 - Add ability to increase verbosity (-v, -vv, -vvv) for debugging.
 - Add timing infrastructure (-t)
   - at minimum verbosity, output nothing but timing info if enabled, on a single line per matrix
     (i.e. if -t, verbosity--, for each -v, verbosity++)
     - cpus, smps/cpu, load-time, ordering-time, solve-time
   - build so we can dump it into a spreadsheet.csv
 - Add ability to save to an output file (-o)
 - Change default to outputing on stdout, rather than default-filename.mm
 - Get this system compiling on sharcnet systems. (TBD which systems to try this on.)
 - Add other solvers - single system, SMP
   ?? which ones
 - Add ability to load multiple files and loop through them?
   - command line list
   - list as input file (-f)
   ?? what to do about output in this case
 - Add ability to download from matrix libraries given input list
   - University of Florida sparse matrix collection
   - Harwell-Boeing sparse matrix collection
 ?? are there any other stats we'd like to collect?
 - Add type tests: condition number, singularity, symmetric, hermitian
   ?? others
 - Make some default lists of common matrices used in papers.
 - Look at KCachegrind, Callgrind for profiling.
