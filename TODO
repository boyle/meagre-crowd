Things that should get done at some point.

If you have free time and are interested in looking at any of these,
have a look at the relevant code and drop an email to me
<alistair.js.boyle@gmail.com>. I'd be more than pleased to look
at any patches or discuss potential solutions.

These are somewhat arranged in order of priority. Highest at the top.

 - Run valgrind. Find bad allocations and uninitialized variables.
 - Add ability to save to an output file (-o)
   - allow outputing on stdout
 - ability to compare results vs. expected (testing!) w/in a certain precision
   - precision might not need to be an option if there's an heuristic we can use (1e-14?)
   - add tests for mumps, umfpack solvers
   - add unit tests for solvers, args, file
 - add input list option to launcher (what matrices to run)
 - make summary script run when launched jobs complete (sqsub --wait?)
 ?? are there any other stats we'd like to collect?
 - Add type tests: condition number, singularity, symmetric, hermitian, real, complex
   ?? others
 - Make some default lists of common matrices used in papers.
 - Look at KCachegrind, Callgrind for profiling.
 - Generate a (random?) (sparse?) right-hand-side if one is not provided.
 - for summary, when a failed test is encountered, add it to an summary.err file
   so its easy to see where those happened

Fix memory leaks:
 - there is a leak in one of the shared libraries atexit() - probably
   the BeBop sparse matrix loader library, maybe rewrite/extract the bits
   I need and clean it up, it seems to be only partially functional from my tests
