Compiling and Installing
------------------------

Run the following commands to compile this program

./configure
make
make install

Run

./configure --prefix=<dir>

to have the files installed in a different location from the
default /usr/local (i.e. if you don't have root permission
and would like to install it in your home directory)

If you've used the get_dependancies script then you probably
want to run configure with

./configure LDFLAGS="-L$(pwd)/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib -Wl,-rpath,$(pwd)/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib" CPPFLAGS="-I $(pwd)/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/include" --prefix=/home/boyle/proj/meagre-crowd/installed --enable-debug=yes

or something similar. The -L and -I directories should be
current locations for the files, while the -rpath should
be the final installed location.

Running the Tests
-----------------
To execute the test suite run

make check

Preparing for Distribution
--------------------------
To tar the archive, then expand, compile and run the test suite

make distcheck
make distcheck DISTCHECK_CONFIGURE_FLAGS='LDFLAGS="-L/home/boyle/proj/meagre-crowd/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib -Wl,-rpath,/home/boyle/proj/meagre-crowd/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/lib" CPPFLAGS="-I /home/boyle/proj/meagre-crowd/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/include"'


Running the Program
-------------------

You can get test matrices from the University of Florida Sparse
Matrix collection. The first 292 matrices of the Univesity of
Florida collection are the Harwell-Boeing Sparse Matrix
collection, so you don't need to download both.

  wget http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/mat/ChangeLog


To load a matrix to solve, show some info on the matrix and time the solving of it:

  mpirun -n N ./meagre-crowd -i dir/abc.mm -v -t

  where N is the number of processors available.
